# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m Alex
- I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo who's interested in trying out as many areas of software development as I can.
- Right now I am working on a MERN task manager that displays relevant vidoes to help students complete their tasks. 
- In my spare time I love to play soccer and basketball, read broadly, and hang out with my pets (I have a new puppy!!).
